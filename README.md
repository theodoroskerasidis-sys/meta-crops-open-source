# meta-crops-open-source# Meta-Crops Open Source

Meta-Crops is a digital remote farming system designed to connect global users who need new income opportunities with rural farmers in Rwanda who lack stable employment. Our model provides a fully managed agricultural solution, where the Meta-Crops team handles every step from planting to harvesting and selling the final product.

This repository contains open-source documentation and components of the Meta-Crops platform. Its purpose is to promote transparency, collaboration, and accessible agricultural innovation for communities in developing regions.

## What is included in this repository

- Basic documentation about the remote farming model  
- Data structure examples for monitoring and field activity tracking  
- Early development notes for our iMeta machine automation  
- Templates for farm activity logs and reporting formats  
- Open-source files that will be expanded as the project grows  

## Why this repository exists

This repository supports our application to the UNICEF Venture Fund.  
We are committed to making key parts of the Meta-Crops technology open and accessible, especially components that can help small farmers, women and youth in rural communities increase productivity and income.
